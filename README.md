# learning-tailwind
This is a small project setup to learn how to use TailwindCSS.

To run this project first open a terminal in the root of this project and run:

```npm run watch-css```

After that has run, you can either globally install the live-server npm package and run:

`live-server public`

in a separate terminal, or you can open the public/index.html file in a browser.
